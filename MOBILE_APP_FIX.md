# Mobile App Fix - Android Studio Issue

## Problem
The mobile app was showing only a simple demo screen with information about the app instead of the actual FlashScore application with leagues, matches, and navigation.

## Root Cause
The `mobile/App.tsx` file was configured to show a `SimpleApp` demo component instead of the full application with proper navigation and features.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enabled Full Application
Changed `mobile/App.tsx` from:
```tsx
// Simple demo version (remove this for production)
return <SimpleApp />;
```

To:
```tsx
return (
  <SafeAreaProvider>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <AppNavigator />
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </SafeAreaProvider>
);
```

### 2. Mobile API Configuration
Updated `mobile/src/services/apiService.ts` to handle React Native platform differences:
- Uses `localhost:3001` for web testing
- Uses `10.0.2.2:3001` for Android emulator
- Added fallback mock data for development

### 3. App Features Now Available
The mobile app now includes:
- **Home Tab**: Shows live scores and fixtures with date/league filtering
- **Live Tab**: Real-time live matches with auto-refresh
- **Leagues Tab**: Browse leagues and standings
- **Navigation**: Full stack navigation with match details
- **Theming**: Dark/light mode support
- **Data**: Real API integration with fallback mock data

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   API should be running on http://localhost:3001

2. Install mobile dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npm install
   ```

### Testing Options

#### Option 1: Android Studio/Emulator
1. Open Android Studio
2. Start an Android emulator
3. In the mobile directory:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
4. Press 'a' to open on Android or scan QR code with Expo Go app

#### Option 2: iOS Simulator (macOS only)
1. In the mobile directory:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
2. Press 'i' to open on iOS simulator

#### Option 3: Web Testing
1. In the mobile directory:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --web
   ```
2. Open http://localhost:8081 in browser

#### Option 4: Physical Device
1. Install Expo Go app on your phone
2. In the mobile directory:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
3. Scan the QR code with your phone

## What You Should See

### Before Fix (Demo Screen)
- Simple information screen about React Native migration
- No navigation tabs
- No leagues or matches visible
- Just static content about the app

### After Fix (Full App)
- Bottom navigation with 3 tabs: Home, Live, Leagues
- Home tab shows matches with date picker and league selector
- Live tab shows live matches (may be empty if no live matches)
- Leagues tab shows all available leagues (Premier League, La Liga, etc.)
- Fully functional sports app interface

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:
1. You should see 3 navigation tabs at the bottom
2. Go to "Leagues" tab - you should see leagues like "Premier League", "La Liga", etc.
3. Go to "Home" tab - you should see match listings or "No matches found"
4. The app should have proper navigation and not just static demo content

## API Data Available

The app connects to the API server which provides:
- **Leagues**: Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Champions League
- **Matches**: Sample matches with different statuses (Live, Finished, Scheduled)
- **Teams**: Various teams from different leagues
- **Events**: Match events like goals, cards, substitutions
- **Standings**: League tables and team statistics

## Troubleshooting

### If you see the demo screen:
- Check that you pulled the latest changes
- Verify `mobile/App.tsx` shows the full app code (not SimpleApp)
- Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`

### If leagues don't load:
- Check that the API server is running on localhost:3001
- Test API directly: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/leagues/`
- The app will fall back to mock data if API is unavailable

### If the app won't start:
- Run `npx expo install --fix` to fix dependency versions
- Clear Metro cache and restart: `npx expo start --clear`
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
